# astar-dev-template

This repository is a playground for creating a standard repo with predefined settings. It is not intended to contain a full solution.

The repository contains a placeholder (i.e. empty) class library along with a test project. The GitHub actions are configured for a build and running the tests as well as a separate Dependabot Action.

About the only things remaining are:

- Update the example solution as required
- Update the pipeline as required
- Add any repository / environment secrets you require. (if using environment secrets, you will need to make additional changes to the pipeline)

Happy developing!
